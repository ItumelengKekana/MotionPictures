## Reflection

This is a project I started in November 2023 after I was unfortunately let go from my company as Software Developer due to budget constraints. The aim of this project was to finally expose myself to the .NET environment and C# in particular after having enough time outside of work. One of the goals of this project was to use the knowledge I had from other technologies such as React to further my knowledge and improve my skills in software development as a whole.

I set out to build one of my first full-stack applications using something other than React and Node. The speed and ease at which we can develop applications which are close to industry standards is one of the main reasons that I chose .NET. The main gripe I had with React and similar, is the countless number of dependencies that we have to rely on to sometimes do the simplest things. The built-in features and dependency injection have made working in this environment very pleasant.

One of the main challenges I have run into thus far is Identity Management and how scaffolding works in particular. This led me to spending a few days on a reasearch spike into the .NET framework, scaffolding, and NuGet packages. I was initially working with .NET 6 in order to familiarise myself with a version that most companies around me are most likely still using. I was able to gather however from forums, that the problems with scaffolding occur in .NET 6 and that upgrading to .NET 7 or 8 would fix these issues; it turned out to be true.

The technologies implemented in this project are ASP.NET Core MVC, EF Core, Stripe, Bootstrap, SQL Server, JavaScript, and CSS.
